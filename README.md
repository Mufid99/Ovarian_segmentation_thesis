# Ovarian Segmentation Thesis
This repository contains code for the preparation of the Ovarian Cyst dataset to be used in the production of a model which could segment Ovarian cyst features
with a high degree of accuracy. The dataset is not available publicly and therefore this repository will not contain the dataset utilised or the model produced.
The model is generated by using **[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)**. This repository also has code to extend the 
functionality of nnU-Net allowing the segmentation of single tensors without the need to read and write to and from image files. This allows the creation of a tool that
can segment a video stream being sent from an ultrasound machine which is also implemented in this repository. 

The preparation mainly involves preprocessing techniques to do one of the following:
-  Removing images (either duplicates or faulty segmentation)
-  Fixing segmentation (error when labelling which would not be logical)
-  Cropping images to remove text from ultrasound machine
-  Resampling images to a smaller size so can be handled by GPU more efficiently

Two approaches were taken to segment the ultrasound video stream. The first uses a remote machine to apply the segmentation while the second approach does the segmentation locally.
